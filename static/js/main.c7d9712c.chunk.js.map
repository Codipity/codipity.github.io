STO or security\n                        token offering is a method of raising capital by issuing tokenized securities. A security\n                        token is backed by external, tradable assets, and can represent a real share of the company.\n                        Security tokens give you ownership rights, whereas utility tokens are more like a gift card\n                        for company products/services.\n                    </p>\n                    <br/>\n                    <h4>What’s the process of doing an STO or an ICO?</h4>\n                    <p>The first step is to have a clear and understandable business proposal for the market. You\n                        need to be able to write down a decent business plan (a white paper) with the details of the\n                        planned activities and the market where you operate in.

Any kind of capital raise requires serious commitment of time and resources,\n                        and a very strong value proposition to succeed.\n                    </p><br/>\n                    <h4>How are your services priced?</h4>\n                    <p>From the legal perspective, doing a security token offering is more demanding and the costs\n                        that will occur are considerably higher compared to costs that will occur by conducting an\n                        ICO.

In some cases, you will need to e-register yourself and all members of the team, \n                    then pick up your documents at the Estonian embassy nearest you. It is important to reach out to us first, however, because in some cases, \n                    you may not need a cryptocurrency or ewallet license at all, and the process might be much easier.\n                    <ol className=\"privacy_text-ol\">\n                    \n                    </ol>\n                    <p> If you are merely looking for DIY artist contracts for bands, singers, or perfomers of any kind, or contracts for film or television projects,\n                        reach out to us at Serene@Codipity.com.

The Estonian cryptocurrency license is generally the most\n                    inexpensive to acquire, the Estonian regulatory bodies are quite pro-business, and the Estonian\n                    Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is supportive and helpful. Most digital entrepreneurs agree\n                    that the small country of Estonia leverages its size and forward thinking attitudes to create a\n                    welcoming environment that is 5-years ahead of jurisdictions like the United States.\n                    <br/> <br/> The Estonian cryptocurrency license allows access to the European Union market and many other\n                    jurisdictions in Asia and South America. However, as of March 10th, 2020, there are new regulations\n                    for all cryptocurrency businesses registered in Estonia. By virtue of the regulations, existing\n                    license holders had until July 1st, 2020 to comply with the new laws which required existing\n                    companies that were already e-registered to now host Point of Contact (POC) Board Members seated\n                    in local offices. There have been other changes as well. For more information on these changes,\n                    as well as additional regulations concerning license procurement, check out our article\n                    titled <a href='/article-starting-eu2'> Tip #2: The EU Crypto License Process</a>.\n                </p><br/> \n                \n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"site-block__wrapper\">\n            <p className='article-p-margin'> Obtaining a cryptocurrency license in Estonia comes with some challenges,\n                        particularly as a foreign entrepreneur or investor, however, as mentioned,\n                        there are huge advantages for start-ups registering in Estonia.\n                        It is the opinion of Codipity LLC, the global leader in crypto and e-money\n                        corporate registrations, that Estonia is the best location on the planet, in almost all cases,\n                        for bootstrapped crypto start-ups. We have therefore compiled some basic recommendations for\n                        entrepreneurs looking to register crypto businesses or raise money in the EU, as well as\n                        existing companies seeking clarity, as there have been other regulatory changes\n                        relevant to those companies also. Here is that list:</p></div>\n            <div className=\"site-block__wrapper\">\n\n                <ol className=\"privacy_text-ol\">\n                    \n                    <li>\n                        You will be required to provide criminal record documentation.\n                        Where that company cannot fulfil the requirement of proof of a\n                        non-criminal record, the FIU will decline the application.\n                        If you have a minor criminal offense, like Driving While Intoxicated, our\n                        experience is that this is not an issue, although if it was very recent, it might be.\n                        If you have committed financial crimes, or have been involved in financial misappropriation,\n                        your application will be scrutinized.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        You will find that United States and EU citizens can move to Estonia with relative ease, whereas\n                        applicants from other countries, such as Russia, may experience yearly quotas, and should\n                        therefore\n                        apply for residency on January 1st. The Estonian government claims that some types of jobs,\n                        such as IT, do not have quotas, although some applicants have reported difficulties.\n                        The first step would be to register all owners, and all members of the team that are moving to Estonia as\n                        e-residents at <a\n                        href='https://e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/'>e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/ </a>.\n                        You should do this as soon as possible because it can take about 5 weeks to\n                        process and pick-up your ID in your own country. Alternatively, you can grant Codipity a\n                        Power of Attorney privilege to handle your incorporation in Estonia.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        There are regulatory requirements for your local team. It is recommended that your Local\n                        Board Member have a spotless criminal record, and that your Anti-Money Laundering professional\n                        have a law, finance, or business degree. It is not always required that the AML be located in\n                        Estonia, although the FIU may want to interview the individual in person. In some instances\n                        for some companies, they may require the AML to be local. To avoid hiccups, hire locally.\n                        Sometimes the Local Board Member and the AML can be the same person, although an application\n                        structured as such can take longer and invite more scrutiny. Some companies hire Codipity\n                        personnel on a six month or one year contract, to ensure a smooth application process, and then\n                        bring in their own replacements.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        There are other service providers that handle compliance and staffing in the same way that\n                        Codipity does. In some instances they will assign you a part-time employee, as some of them sit\n                        on the board of multiple companies. Be careful of this approach, because it can result in their\n                        attention and focus being divided amongst many responsibilities, which may result in\n                        unsatisfactory work. More importantly, the FIU will likely scrutinize your team, if this is\n                        the case. Hence, when you make an application for a cryptocurrency license and the\n                        FIU discovers the name of your contact person or compliance officer on multiple applications,\n                        your application is likely to be flagged and queried. Any part-time employee Codipity hires on\n                        your behalf, works only for you as a Compliance or AML professional, even if they are part-time\n                        employees. We work as a staffing agency, in some ways, so if you want to hire your Codipity\n                        assigned personnel at the end of a six month or one year contract, you may do so.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        There are office requirements for your staff.

In your application your Estonian Board Member must provide\n                        documentation proving Estonian residency. Often a utility bill is requested. Your Local\n                        Board Member can be a resident. They do not have to be an Estonian citizen.

Luckily, it is our opinion at Codipity LLC, the global leader in Crypto and E-money\n                    Corporate Registrations, that Estonia is by far the best jurisdiction in Europe, and probably the\n                    world, for gaining a crypto license. Compared to the less than welcoming business conditions crypto\n                    companies find in most parts of the world, and the archaic money transmitter licensing system in the\n                    United States, Estonia is an easy choice for the best place to register your bootstrapped crypto\n                    company.

In Estonia, a cryptocurrency business requires an Activity License\n                    for the Provision of Financial Services, under which the Provision of Virtual Currency Services is\n                    issued by the Financial Intelligence Unit. </p>\n                <br/>\n                <p>To obtain the license, you must register your company (or a subsidiary or parent of your company), as\n                    an LLC in Estonia. Most entrepreneurs e-register their company, however, this is not compulsory,\n                    because obtaining the license may be done through a Power of Attorney at a local branch office. For\n                    a foreign company registering an affiliate in Estonia, as opposed to foreign persons registering a\n                    company, the process for obtaining a license is more complicated, because additional notarized\n                    documents are required ensuring your existing corporation is on good ethical and financial terms, in\n                    your current jurisdiction. The prerequisites to registering your Estonian crypto company are as\n                    follows:</p>\n                <ol className=\"privacy_text-ol\">\n                    <li>\n                        <b>Hire your Management Board.</b> The registration of the company is contingent on having a\n                        management\n                        board member, and often, a compliance officer, who resides in Estonia. As described in the\n                        Income Tax Act, these individuals must have good business reputations. In some cases, the\n                        compliance officer may live elsewhere, however, it might be necessary for her to go to Estonia\n                        for an in-person interview.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <b>Register your Business.</b> Business registration is one of the essential criteria for\n                        obtaining the license.

The second is when the provision of evidence of a non-\n                        criminal record has not been sufficiently detailed. When the applicant is owned by a parent company\n                        or when a foreign corporate shareholder cannot provide proof of non-criminality, it poses a\n                        logistical problem. While founder backgrounds are generally not difficult to prove, it is quite\n                        difficult to prove non-criminality for a registering parent entity, if the new Estonian company is a\n                        subsidiary. </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <img src={ImageArticle02} className=\"privacy-warning-img-page rightFloat\"/>\n                </div>\n                <p className='marginTop20'> Usually, the FIU requests the criminal records of the foreign company, and its members,\n                    along with the names of its Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBO’s). However, in the absence of proof of\n                    a non-criminality, a company can provide a statement indicating a clean history from a federal or\n                    state registry in the country where the company was originally set-up. Generally, it is safer to\n                    avoid the complications of applying for the license using foreign corporate shareholders. When the\n                    company is eventually registered and has obtained the license, it qualifies as a financial\n                    institution, and can at that time more easily add additional documents, ownership structures, and\n                    people. Regardless, foreign entities are not subject to special tax or reporting requirements and\n                    accounting is required according to EU and Estonian law, just like every other Estonian company.\n                    Luckily, companies like Codipity provide this service on a yearly basis, for a flat-rate, in year\n                    one, and will renegotiate in year 2, after understanding the scope of the accounting and tax work\n                    your company requires. </p>\n                <p className=\"article-p-small\">See FIU advisory guidelines <a\n                    href='https://www2.politsei.ee/dotAsset/39481.pdf'>https://www2.politsei.ee/dotAsset/39481.pdf </a>\n                </p>\n                <p className='article-p-margin'>\n                    The FIU can also make inquiries on the activities of the company.

The applicant’s contact person or compliance officer meets with the FIU,\n                    face-to-face, in Estonia. There, the FIU confirms that the representative understands the AML rules,\n                    and the relevant EU laws, which deal with money laundering and the financing of terrorism. When the\n                    FIU requests a meeting, the licensee has 60 days to set an appointment in Estonia to meet with the\n                    FIU.

Under federal law, a money transmitter falls under the purview of a US Money\n                    Service Business (MSB). For MSBs, a federal license is issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement\n                    Network (FinCEN), of the United States Department of Treasury. Thereafter, most MSBs must acquire\n                    Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in each individual state and territory, which means that,\n                    generally speaking, the task is herculean, and at times, downright maddening for entrepreneurs. In\n                    all, it can take up to two years to complete. Clearly stated, MTLs are difficult to come by in the\n                    US, and require a lot of legal wrangling. Crypto companies and e-money companies, in particular,\n                    bear the brunt of this bureaucracy. Generally, it motivates US entrepreneurs, who would otherwise\n                    choose a US jurisdiction, to first register companies abroad. The real losers are US taxpayers, and\n                    the many schools, roads and bridges that could be subsidized with fintech taxes. Because of the\n                    archaic way in which the US system is structured, US taxpayers lose millions each year in tax\n                    revenues when US born entrepreneurs in the digital payments sector register companies in\n                    pro-business jurisdictions like the EU. Eventually, these entrepreneurs might release their\n                    technologies in the US, after launching their company elsewhere.\n                </p>\n\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"privacy_flex-column site-block__wrapper margin-top-0\">\n                <p>But by doing so the lion’s share of\n                    tax revenues go to that non-US jurisdiction. In some cases, the entrepreneurs are incorporated in,\n                    and paying taxes to, a country they have never even visited. Most incubators and start-up hubs\n                    understand that the next Facebook, Google, or Amazon may not be a US company, because the US is\n                    failing to retain and recruit innovators. The truth is that while the US is floundering, small\n                    countries in the EU like Estonia are recruiting A-list entrepreneurs from premier start-up programs\n                    and US Universities. Transferwise, a company registered in Estonia, despite being a product of\n                    Silicon Valley’s Y-Combinator start-up school, are a prime example of a billion dollar company that\n                    opted for the EU, but may have stayed in the US, if the United States were friendly to businesses\n                    operating as payment service providers.\n                </p>\n\n\n\n                <div className=\"flex site-block__wrapper marginTop20 column-wrap\">\n                    <img src={ImageArticle01} className=\" leftimg marginTop20\"/>\n                    <div className='flex-column marginTop10'>\n                    <h2>How did it get this way?</h2>\n                        <p className=\"article-p-margin\">In a bid to create a uniform system and consistent approach to the way\n                            money services are carried\n                            out, the Uniform Money Services Act was passed in 2000 as a guideline for MSBs. At the federal\n                            level, registering an MSB is not difficult. It is in the states, where the problems lie. While it is\n                            possible for the founder of an MSB to submit an application to the National Multi-State Licensing\n                            system (NMLS) herself, most decide to hire a US-based attorney (at $200-$500 per hour) to\n                            handle the extremely complex application process, because, on a scale of 1 to 10, the difficulty and\n                            magnitude of the MTL process is a 9 or a 10. Each state has an application and a separate fee. State\n                            fees will total somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 and attorney fees will generally cost an\n                            additional $300,000 or more. Unfortunately, most early stage start-ups do not have this kind of\n                            money prior to having customers. On top of that, banks and trusts charge up to $10,000 per month for\n                            a deposit account where payment service providers or e-money technologies can pool their funds,\n                            although these costs vary, largely depend on the type of service a company provides, and rely on how\n                            a technology operates. In no uncertain terms, to launch an e-money business in the United States is\n                            next to impossible without funding or private wealth.\n\n                        </p></div>\n                </div>\n\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">To combat this nightmare, most entrepreneurs\n                    choose to register their company, initially, in a more business friendly jurisdiction. Others opt\n                    for more efficient processes in the US where they are exempt from MSB status, or they choose to\n                    partner with a service provider like Codipity, the global leader in corporate registrations and\n                    consultations, to handle the state-by-state MTLs, at a flat-rate. Codipity not only assists with the\n                    registration process, but also helps companies document the flow of funds, explore license coverage,\n                    and submit the necessary applications to each state. In essence, Codipity helps entrepreneurs\n                    navigate the entire Money Service Business process. To be clear, although Codipity is registered in\n                    the EU as a “Trust and Company Services” provider, the organization specifically offers its MTL\n                    service from its US-based office, spearheaded by a US-licensed attorney. Codipity clients therefore\n                    receive discounted rates on US legal work. In some cases, Codipity will conduct legal or\n                    consultatory work in exchange for equity. Prior to using Codipity, however, an entrepreneur should consider all\n                    of the options at their disposal. Therefore, the following 6 strategies are recommended by Codipity\n                    for entrepreneurs seeking Money Transmitter Licenses. Start-ups can (1) affiliate; (2) become a\n                    correspondent; (3) become an Independent Sales Organization; (4) enter an agent program; (5) own a\n                    license; or, (6) become a banking agent.</p>\n\n\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Affiliate</h2>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">As an affiliate, you are responsible for the sale of the product or\n                    services on behalf of a license holder and you gain commission on each transaction you effect.\n                    Basically, you are unlicensed, but can carry on business just like a person or business entity that\n                    is licensed to do so. By law, an affiliate cannot access, disburse or spend any funds because the\n                    client is actually that of the principal license holder. Hence, the principal license holder is\n                    responsible for handling the funds. If you are a payments app that merely takes a transaction fee,\n                    but does not have access to the sender accounts or the receiver accounts, you are generally\n                    structured as an affiliate. Companies like Stripe, Dwolla, and Plaid facilitate these types of\n                    white-label transactions for you, through the Buyer and Seller bank accounts. While you can take\n                    transaction fees as an affiliate, your company is never in possession of the actual funds being\n                    transferred. These are sometimes referred to as “white-label” relationships because your company\n                    branding will remain on the service, but you are not actually conducting the transaction. Your\n                    ability to utilize an affiliate relationship is a question of how you have designed your technology\n                    to facilitate the flow of funds. </p>\n\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Correspondent</h2>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\"> Unlike an affiliate, a correspondent is a partner of the principal\n                    license holder who receives legal instruction to effect cross border transactions. Correspondence is\n                    not limited to individuals or licensed personnel; it is most often referenced in the context of\n                    banking. Entrepreneurs in the digital payments sector will therefore need to find a correspondent\n                    bank to conduct business in the United States. There are domestic correspondents and foreign\n                    correspondents. If you are a European entity, your US correspondent would be a foreign\n                    correspondent. To be a foreign correspondent, a contract between you and the principal license\n                    holder in the US is required. This contract allows for transactions to be sent for settlement or\n                    termination. In each case, a correspondent agreement is required; this agreement must be presented\n                    to state regulators in the event of an audit. Just like an affiliate is not legally empowered to\n                    touch funds, as a correspondent, you are not legally empowered to enact transactions from the US,\n                    independent of the principal license holder. However, a correspondent can receive funds from a US\n                    Money Service Business (MSB). Local correspondents are internally licensed entities who offer\n                    similar services in jurisdictions where you are not licensed. In this case, a correspondent contract\n                    does not invoke licensure rights on the contract but merely allows for a transaction to be settled.\n                    It is pertinent to mention that when a transaction originates from a correspondent, that\n                    correspondent has legal ownership of it, and neither the domestic nor the foreign correspondent can\n                    canvas business in the other’s country. For example, a Puerto Rican bank, called an International\n                    Financial Entity (IFE), therefore, will need to find a US correspondent bank if it wishes to acquire\n                    US customers who are individuals rather than businesses. </p>\n\n\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Independent Sales Organization</h2>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\"> Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) can also be used for money\n                    transmission. An ISO Agreement serves several purposes. First, the ISO agreement is issued by the\n                    Principal License Holder to the ISO which enables the ISO to sell or promote its products and\n                    services. Basically, the Agreement is established by the Principal License Holder in order to market\n                    their own products or services, however an ISO also acts as a correspondent. In its dealings with\n                    the Money Service Business, the Money Service Business remains the legal owner, and the flow of\n                    funds passes through the bank account of the Money Service Business, but the ISO can still solicit\n                    or canvass for business in the Principal License Holder’s jurisdiction. The websites, apps, and\n                    platforms that the ISO uses to sell the products remains property of the ISO, not the PLH. </p>\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Agent Program</h2>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\"> Agent programs allow entrepreneurs to acquire money transmitter\n                    licenses from a corporate entity who is a Principal License Holder. In this kind of arrangement, the\n                    start-up is a Money Transfer Operator (MTO) and functions as an authorized delegate. At launch, the\n                    start-up can own its own brand and directly onboard clients in the interest of the Principal License\n                    Holder. In this arrangement, the flow of funds travels through the bank of the Principal License\n                    Holder, and the products or services that the start-up markets must be in line with the services the\n                    Principal License Holder sells. Each agent working for the start-up must be conscious of this rule\n                    for the sake of regulatory compliance. Usually statutory regulators monitor the nature of agency\n                    relationships because there have been some careless PLH arrangements that have turned criminal.\n                    Criminality occurs when a license is “rented” and unmonitored by the Principal License Holder. If\n                    your start-up intends to carry out business that falls within the territory of the state of Texas,\n                    for example, there are relevant cases which cracked down on PLH’s who rented their licenses and did\n                    not properly monitor the usage. The <a\n                        href='https://www.dob.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/Laws-Regulations/New-Actions/sm1038.pdf'>Supervisory\n                        Memorandum (1038)</a>, from the Texas Department of\n                    Banking (2014), is worth perusing, especially for companies using virtual currencies.\n\n                    As an authorized delegate or agent, you will be required by the license holder to provide a brief\n                    summary of your business. That summary will include a project plan, a projected revenue model for at\n                    least one year, a mapped out funds flow chart including various payment paths (USD v. crypto paths\n                    for example) and the jurisdiction of the business. Most PLHs will require that you indicate the\n                    number of states you will carry out business operations in, as well as the time it will take to\n                    kickstart the business. If your proposal is successful, a Principal License Holder will then allow\n                    you to move on to the next stage of due diligence.\n                </p>\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Banking Agent</h2>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">Banks in the US are not required to adhere to Money Transmitter License\n                    requirements by virtue of their Banking Charter. And, they can appoint subsidiaries who\n                    automatically become free from the rigours of acquiring a Money Transmitter License. </p>\n\n\n                <div className=\"flex site-block__wrapper column-wrap\">\n                    <div className='flex-column marginTop50'>\n                        <h2>Own Your License</h2>\n                        <p className=\"article-p-margin\">Owning your MTL licenses outright is the ideal way to ensure your\n                            ability to run a money service business. Generally, Codipity can register your entity in the US or\n                            get you registered as an MSB, at the federal level, without too much difficulty. However, as\n                            mentioned, the method to acquire MTLs in each state, is no walk in the park. Generally, you must\n                            consider the type of resources you have, the amount of time you have to process the material and\n                            await a response, and the manpower it requires to compile all the documentation. While in the past,\n                            you may have written a white paper as a way to organize your ideas, the Money Transmitter Licenses\n                            will require a robust business plan, and many other documents which are quite complex. For most\n                            entrepreneurs, the main issue confronting their choice concerns the issue of funding. If you are a\n                            bootstrapped crypto startup, the best approach may be to register your company first in an agreeable\n                            environment such as the EU, grow your business, build a clientele base, and garner financial\n                            stability there before tackling the US market because the state licenses will each require you to\n                            demonstrate a minimum net worth, a surety bond of $500,000 or $1,000,000 (depending on the state), a\n                            compliance team, full time backend support, and a tech team.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <img src={ImageArticle02} className=\"privacy-warning-img-page rightImg-sml marginTop80\"/>\n\n                </div>\n                <p className='marginTop10'>You will also be required to meet the\n                    high standards of the US Bank Secrecy Act as it relates to your KYC and AML program. Other factors to\n                    consider are the annual license, solicitor, and audit fees; documentation of criminal convictions in\n                    the last 10 years; financial disclosures from yourself and your investors; and documentation\n                    concerning your banking partnerships and limitations, to name but a few of the documents. After\n                    compiling everything necessary for one state, the most frustrating part of all of it is that the\n                    requirements vary from state to state, so you will need to rinse and repeat the step about 30 times.\n                    The one bit of silver lining through all the bureaucracy is that a group of states do have a\n                    Multi-State MSB Licensing agreement (called the MMLA) which allows you to submit one application for\n                    26 states, at once. California, Illinois and Texas are currently part of that MMLA group, which gets\n                    you some major metropolitan populations such as LA, San Francisco, Chicago, and Houston. The New\n                    York Bit License, however, is a mind blowing $150,000 for just one state. Knowing that similar\n                    licensure to the New York Bit License, is available for the totality of Europe, for about 1/10 the\n                    capital investment, makes most entrepreneurs cringe at the cost-benefit analysis.</p>\n\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Where should I start?</h2>\n\n\n                <p className='article-p-margin'>Generally, apart from meeting the requirements for running a Money\n                    Service Business, Money Transmitters in the US also deal with a variety of supervisory bodies at the\n                    state level, depending on which states the Money Service Business will transact. It is important\n                    for Money Transmitters to institute measures of recordkeeping, file currency reports regularly, and\n                    document suspicious activity with SARs. But, the greatest challenge is understanding each law that\n                    is applicable to conducting business in each state. This is why Codipity does not recommend\n                    bootstrapping this part of your business (in any standard pro se or DIY approach), unless time is\n                    not of the essence and you have 2 or 3 years to get acclimated to the application system.

<img src={ImageArticle} className=\"leftimg\"/>\n                <p>For Money Service Businesses, acquiring Money Transmitter Licenses\n                    (MTLs) in the United States is a difficult process. The degree of difficulty, of course, varies from\n                    state to state, and the extent of an entrepreneur's nightmare depends (1) on the specific state\n                    where she is seeking the license and (2) the type of business she intends to conduct. While the\n                    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regulates the activities of MSBs at the federal level,\n                    each state, save the state of Montana, has local statutes that regulate the operations of money\n                    transmitters. These states require the registration of anyone seeking money transmitter status. Even\n                    though money transmitters in the state of Montana aren’t required to be licensed with the division\n                    of Banking and Financial Institutions like most states require, in order to carry out money transfer\n                    services MSBs must still register as a business with the Montana Secretary of State. There are,\n                    however, common threads linking the registration processes and expectations of each state such as\n                    compulsory fees for license application and renewals. But, because there is no general license that\n                    covers the operation of money transmission services in the US, an applicant must obtain a license in\n                    each state she intends to carry out business. The challenge of this is that she must familiarize\n                    herself with the rules that apply in each of the 50 states and 5 territories, since the rules that\n                    apply in state ‘A’ are likely different from what would apply in state ‘B’.\n                    As a consequence, a\n                    license seeker has to deal with a diverse range of regulations if she wants to operate in each\n                    state.\n                </p>\n\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"privacy_flex-column site-block__wrapper margin-top-0\">\n                <p className='marginTop10'> Moreso, the general license regulatory requirements are susceptible to change or amendments.\n                    While Codipity provides a flat-rate service to lead entrepreneurs through the MTL storm, below are\n                    the links to help pro se (DIY) applicants conduct the research and submit the required documents to\n                    55 different US jurisdictions themselves:\n                </p>\n\n                <ol className=\"privacy_text-ol\">\n                    {linksList.map((item) =>\n                        <li>\n                            <div className=\"flex-column\">\n                                <a href={item.stateNameLink}>{item.stateName}</a>\n                                <a href={item.transferNameLink}>{item.transferName}</a></div>\n                        </li>\n                    )}\n                </ol>\n\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Applicants begin by filling out the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) Forms (1) for\n                    Individuals and (2) for Companies, which are the documents that sole proprietors and companies use\n                    for maintaining non-depository, financial service licenses for state agencies associated with MTLs.\n                    An applicant is also required to list the beneficial owners, and to list the managers. Last, an\n                    applicant must submit the NMLS Branch Form used by companies to apply for and maintain licenses for\n                    each non-depository, financial services branch location, if applicable. As a legal requirement,\n                    applicants also must hold insurance. Various state laws require licensees to obtain surety bonds as\n                    a condition of licensure because when a licensee fails to comply with the requirements, a regulator\n                    files claims against the bond to cover the penalties.\n\n                </p>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Financial regulators are stalwarts of the Money Transmitters Regulators Association (MTRA), an\n                    organization that is responsible for the implementation of the laws in all 55 jurisdictions. The\n                    NMLS, which was instituted by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the American\n                    Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators (AARMR) in 2008, aims to improve coordination,\n                    efficiency and information sharing among regulators and to enhance consumer protection.\n                    Unfortunately, compared to processes in most parts of the world, the US system is considered to be\n                    ineffective, if not broken, as a result of the cumbersome processes involved with obtaining a\n                    license and the lack of uniformity across the states. The difficulties are further exacerbated\n                    because license seekers are rarely confident about what is required. Recently, an NMLS Policy\n                    Guidebook was released as a resource material for applicants, licensees, and regulatory agencies. To\n                    summarize, the requirements handled through common processes include (1) Annual Renewals; (2)\n                    Electronic Surety Bonds; (3) Financial Statements; (4) Advanced Change Notices; (5) Policies; (6)\n                    Professional Standards which include Criminal background checks, Completing pre-licensure education\n                    requirements, Prometric tests, and Credit Report Authorizations; (7) Mortgage Call Reports; (8)\n                    Money Services Businesses Call Reports; (9) Temporary Authorities to Operate; and (10) Uniform\n                    Authorized Agent Delegate Reports. However, with the publication of the guidebook, it is hoped that\n                    applicants will have a proper understanding of the policies that apply when using the NMLS.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"flex site-block__wrapper column-wrap\">\n                    <div className='flex-column'>\n                    <p className=\"marginTop10\">Generally, what makes the application process cumbersome is the ripple\n                        effect across states, industries, and continents because the global community generally looks to the\n                        United States for clarity on economic and financial issues, as the United States is the world’s\n                        largest economy. When the US falters, or fails to correct its inefficiencies, the world suffers\n                        along with the US taxpayers. In some instances however, pro-business foreign governments can fill\n                        the leadership vacuum.

Since 2012, it has\n                    garnered the serious attention of banks and financial service entities, like US broker-dealers, as\n                    an attractive regulatory environment free from US federal taxation. While financial institutions in\n                    Puerto Rico are multiplying rapidly, they are still strictly regulated by the Office of the\n                    Commissioner of Financial Institutions (OCIF) which is in turn regulated by the US Federal Reserve.\n                    Generally, the Puerto Rican jurisdiction is extremely attractive to international banks because they\n                    enjoy access to US markets while also avoiding US taxes. Pfizer International Bank and Santander\n                    Overseas Bank are two global institutions, incorporated in Puerto Rico, among dozens of other global\n                    banking corporations also registered there. While different banking jurisdictions come with their\n                    own affordances and constraints, Puerto Rican International Financial Entities (IFE's) offer\n                    significant economic and strategic advantages, even for smaller scale banking operations and de novo\n                    banking institutions. In fact, in most cases, Codipity LLC, the global leader in corporate banking\n                    registration, recommends that organizations consider Puerto Rico as a destination for their new bank\n                    entity.\n                </p>\n\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"privacy_flex-column site-block__wrapper margin-top-0\">\n                <p className='marginTop10'> There are two key reasons why Puerto Rico is advantageous. First, as\n                    mentioned, as an unincorporated US territory, Puerto Rico governs and regulates itself in matters of\n                    taxation. This means that Puerto Rico can sponsor programs to lure foreign investors, such as a four\n                    percent local tax for International Financial Entities, and zero percent federal tax. Such waivers\n                    on local taxes entice CEOs to relocate their financial entities, as there are scarcely any external\n                    interferences related to taxation, from US regulators, in terms of the policies that apply to Puerto\n                    Rican IFEs. The benefits from tax treaties are possible because offshore jurisdictions are legatees\n                    of the Double Taxation Treaties Agreement (DTTA) which provides for predictable business\n                    environments. Act 273, officially known as the International Financial Center Regulatory Act,\n                    encodes into law the tax exemptions for foreign investors who intend to carry out registered\n                    financial activities in Puerto Rico. And, the Act empowers the OCIF to grant International Banking\n                    Licenses to applicants who meet the legal requirements.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Second, US economic and fiscal policies shape the region, and in some senses, the globe, because\n                    without a correspondent US bank, international banks cannot effect transactions in US dollars.\n                    Dollars remain the world reserve currency due to the strength and size of the United States economy\n                    as a whole, which makes Puerto Rican IFE start-ups better than Central America banking start-ups,\n                    simply because IFEs have better access to USD. In other words, most banks need access to USD because\n                    global transactions and large scale purchases are settled in US dollars. Generally, when a bank\n                    suffers the loss of a correspondent, particularly a US correspondent, the bank funds are frozen and\n                    its financial activities are halted, which is less likely to happen to banks incorporated in Puerto\n                    Rico.\n\n                </p>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Stories of banking gone wrong, abound. For example, in 2010, the Central Bank of Belize lost its\n                    correspondent relationship with HSBC Bank when HSBC terminated all foreign currency cash operations\n                    in Central America. Later, Caye International Bank experienced a similar fate. Generally, a\n                    tightening occurs when US regulators identify suspicious activity related to money laundering or the\n                    funding of terrorism that is ignored or overlooked by banks on a systemic level. The great thing\n                    about Puerto Rican IFEs is that, for all intents and purposes, IFEs are US banks innate to the US\n                    system; therefore correspondence cannot as easily be terminated. Puerto Rico identifies itself as a\n                    “free associated state” because it has some freedoms from taxation and federal governance but\n                    maintains some advantages of statehood. It is an offshore banking destination with some onshore\n                    perks!\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"flex site-block__wrapper column-wrap\">\n                    <div className='flex-column'>\n                        <p className=\"marginTop10\">To incorporate your bank in Puerto Rico you will need to raise about\n                            2.5 million dollars total. To incorporate in the United States, you will need to raise 3 to\n                            5 times that.

For starters, you will need a banking license, and you should understand\n                    that the banking license process is significantly more involved than the mere incorporation of a\n                    company. In fact, you should expressly NOT register a company prior to registering your bank,\n                    because registering a bank is an altogether different process. For new applicants, the Puerto Rican\n                    Commissioner of Financial Institutions (OCIF) provides a menu of bank types to choose from, which\n                    need to be clarified in your application, along with the services you will provide and the clients\n                    you will serve. One interesting thing to note, for example, is that all IFEs must use the word\n                    “International” or “Overseas” in the name of their entity and IFEs cannot serve US-based natural\n                    persons, however they can serve US-based legal persons, like business entities. For example, your\n                    bank can have Facebook as a client, and Facebook can have US individuals as their clients, but you\n                    cannot take US natural persons as your direct clients in any depository way.\n                </p>\n\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"privacy_flex-column site-block__wrapper margin-top-0\">\n                <p className='marginTop10'>To begin, a foreign entrepreneur must know which services she will provide to\n                    her clients. In the application process, some services are easier than others to gain licensure, and\n                    an entrepreneur should keep the initial application as focused as possible. There are reasons to\n                    have well articulated plans that systematically outline the modus operandi of the entity; generally\n                    the more loose ends you include, the more reasons the Commissioner can find to deny your\n                    application, so it is best to know your core business and to describe it thoroughly. All business\n                    plans submitted to the OCIF should follow the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) Business Plan\n                    Guidelines. If you are unsure about writing the business plan yourself, or need expert help on a\n                    variety of matters, Codipity LLC handles all aspects of the application process, including the\n                    business plan, at a flat-rate price. The OCIF requires that an attorney local to Puerto Rico submit\n                    the documentation and handle the negotiations; and, Codipity has a Puerto Rican attorney on staff so\n                    we do not need to send you to another firm. Generally, it makes sense for banks to focus their\n                    efforts on building the team and pitching investors, while professionals with proven formats prepare\n                    the documentation. If interested, the first step is to contract Codipity services. Next, Codipity\n                    prepares your preliminary license application and submits your initial check for $5000 to the OCIF,\n                    notifying them of your intent. The outcome of the preliminary application will determine whether or\n                    not you have permission to submit further documentation to operate the IFE. Later, you will be\n                    required to provide a proof of funds document from your bank for $550,000; eventually $300,000 of\n                    that will be placed as surety in a Puerto Rican bank account. Several months later, you will need a\n                    detailed plan and evidence of the ability to raise the additional 2 to 3 million dollars.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Therefore, financially speaking, there are three key steps. For the first step you will need $5,000\n                    and the preliminary application in order to receive the Permit to Organize. Then you will need\n                    $550,000 in capitalization and some additional documentation to receive the Permit to Operate.\n                    Finally, upon acceptance, you will need to raise an additional $2 to $3 million within 6 months with\n                    the ability to petition for an extra to 6 months. Finally, after producing the last round of capital\n                    you earn the permit to Commence Operations. Clients who reach the final stage, generally, do not\n                    have difficulty raising the 2 to 3 million dollars because the initial process takes about 8 months,\n                    and to have received the go-ahead from the OCIF is often proof positive of competence, and a sound\n                    business plan, to investors.

While the licenses are referred to <i>as permits to organise, permits to\n                    operate\n                </i> and <i>permits to commence operations</i>, all documents provided during the three phases of the\n                    application process will serve to demonstrate the strength and integrity of the financial entity.\n                    Therefore, a permit to organise signals acceptance by the government to kickstart IFE operations but\n                    it does not grant a license to conduct business. The Commissioner of Financial Institutions may\n                    grant, conditionally grant or even deny an application for the license at various stages of the\n                    process. Once permission to organize has been given, other necessities like building compliance\n                    infrastructures and hiring a team can follow. To earn a <i>permit to operate</i> additional\n                    requirements\n                    must be in place. As you progress through each stage, you will file your IFE licenses at the Puerto\n                    Rican Department of State within 10 days from the date of issuance. Your IFE should request tax\n                    exemption from the Department of Economic Development and Commerce (DDEC) in Puerto Rico.\n                </p>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Puerto Rico previously required five employees as the minimum but with changes made to Puerto Rico’s\n                    Act 20 and 22 since July 2017, that requirement was abdicated with no employee requirement. This\n                    gave way for more flexibility in business operations. You can be based in the US and operate the\n                    venture through a Puerto Rico company, and get the tax deferral at 4%. In that case, you are\n                    required to take a fair market salary that’s taxable and report the same on Form W-2 (Puerto Rico’s\n                    electronic filing specification).\n\n                </p>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Also, you can conveniently run a business as a sole proprietor and qualify for the Act 20 4% tax\n                    rate so long the conduct of the business is done in Puerto Rico. It is referred to as Puerto Rico\n                    sourced income. With Puerto Rico currently seeking to be a sizable hub for regional and\n                    international business ventures, the necessity for the amendment of the law is further brought to\n                    the fore. Apart from no imposition of federal taxes and the income tax rate being fixed, there is\n                    100% tax exemption on dividends, 100% exemption on property tax for the first 5 years after which it\n                    becomes 90%, also, on municipal taxes, there is 60% exemption. Depending on the location in Puerto\n                    Rico, the business might get 90% on municipal taxes if set up within an ‘industrial development\n                    zone’. These rates can be renewed for another 10 years subject to certain terms and conditions. The\n                    IFE may any person incorporated under Puerto Rican laws, US laws or the laws of other territory. The\n                    start point for such a person is to pay a non refundable fee of $5,000 at the point of filing the\n                    application for the permit. After which he is to essentially comply with the requirements as\n                    stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act. Exemptions may be granted to an IFE, for example exemption\n                    from CTR filing requirements. Note that exemptions are of 2 types (phase 1 and phase 2). Exemption\n                    from CTR filing requirements will apply in Puerto Rico largely based on the fact that by virtue of\n                    the Bank Secrecy Act, any entity exercising governmental authority within the U.S. (U.S. includes\n                    District of Columbia, Territories, and Indian tribal lands) falls under the category of an exempt\n                    person.\n                </p>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Worthy of note is the fact that the authorized capital stock shall not be less than $5,000,000 of\n                    which $250,000 must have been fully paid at the time the license is issued.

Those changes are fast- paced and cut across virtually every sector,\n                        revolutionizing finance, and making it possible for people to access money services who\n                        previously only had access to local currencies and tangible forms of trade. The change to\n                        digital currencies has facilitated unique experiences in the gaming sector and is similarly\n                        projected to have large scale impacts in the music business. Specifically, key changes, due to\n                        advancements from fintechs that harness blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, will\n                        significantly affect music creators and owners of music rights.\n                        <br/><br/>\n                        In the last 100 years of recorded music, artists had to rely on record labels, promoters and\n                        distributors to share their artistry with larger audiences and to plan and sell those\n                        connections with their fans; an alluring deal for most early stage creators which came at a\n                        high, long term price. As a matter of fact, this process, to a large extent, put control of\n                        artist revenues in the hands of management companies and record labels, homogenizing music for\n                        the sake of profitability and making it possible for an artist to be easily controlled. In some\n                        cases, unfair compensation and poor management processes have rendered artists mere shadows of\n                        their former selves, choosing to resign from the spotlight altogether rather than fight or sue\n                        their way out of bureaucratic nightmares. </p>\n\n                   \n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"privacy_flex-column site-block__wrapper\">\n\n                <p className='article-p-margin'>\n                    However, with the digitisation of music, the democratisation of music sharing on spaces like\n                    youtube, and key advancements in blockchain and financial technologies, prospects for independent\n                    music creators are improving. This is true because technologies now allow artists to promote and\n                    sell digital products while controlling their careers all by themselves- an alluring proposition\n                    that comes with creative and financial advantages. In some cases, on platforms like ifanbase.com,\n                    artists now securitize and sell ‘stock’ in their albums, prior to, or following the album’s\n                    completion, via digital tokens which represent securities, ownership stakes in the work, or its\n                    royalties. Importantly, on these platforms, artists now choose their own contract terms and lengths,\n                    and are bargaining with adoring fans from positions of authority, as opposed to positions of\n                    subordination in relation to large media organizations. In most cases artists choose contracts which\n                    allow them to get their royalty shares back, at the conclusion of their sharing obligations, which\n                    they themselves have selected in their royaltyshare contracts.\n\n                </p>\n                <p className='article-p-margin'>For artists, independence is now more possible than ever, because there\n                    are opportunities for artists to distribute their own music via services like iTunes, Spotify, and\n                    YouTube and because blockchain and cryptocurrencies now facilitate crowdfunding and crowd-sharing\n                    scenarios for those artists to raise the money to produce and promote their albums. Because of\n                    platforms like ifanbase.com, the music industry is gradually seeing a transition to more flexible,\n                    artist-centered outcomes for creators and fans in large part because blockchain transactions,\n                    conducted on public ledgers, are more transparent, inclusive and accessible across the globe as\n                    music products and as digital securities unbound by national borders.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <p>The precursor to the distributed ledger system used now by companies like ifanbase.com for music and\n                    music financing, was the Bitcoin distributed ledger. But, since its invention in 2009, there have\n                    been many derivative blockchains which improve upon Bitcoin’s original architecture. The most\n                    prominent is the Ethereum network, of which ifanbase.com has partnered and developed its own\n                    self-hosted private chain, allowing it to conduct blockchain transactions at near zero costs to\n                    consumers, whereas Ethereum mainnet transactions can have high costs to consumers and slower\n                    transaction times due to congestion. </p>\n                <br/>\n                <p>Generally, distributed ledgers are databases which are publicly viewable, but not owned by any single\n                    authority, so the systems function transparently because the data on the blockchain is unchangeable\n                    once created. This means that the proprietary rights and interests of music artists cannot be\n                    altered or manipulated and the value does not need middlemen to be digitally transferred. In other\n                    words, decentralized databases are crucial for music artists because they maintain a chain of\n                    ongoing transactions which are traceable by the artist. </p>\n\n                <br/>\n                <p>For example, if someone purchases an album, or an artist transfers his proprietary rights in a\n                    musical work to someone else, the record of that transaction is instantly recorded on the public\n                    ledger blockchain. This provides clarity and closure on intellectual property sales and transparency\n                    between artists and partners without the need for middlemen. It also includes an artist’s fans in\n                    the commercial and promotional aspects of the production pipeline because fans can promote the work\n                    online and take on the collective role of a label.</p>  <br/>\n                    \n                    <p>A former Media Studies professor, the current CEO of ifanbase.com, believes “the general public\n                    will gain a more nuanced understanding of market forces and a broader perspective on cultural\n                    products, as they more closely examine the economics of artistry as opposed to just the\n                    entertainment or personal value of songs.” In other words, by owning ‘shares’ of albums or digital\n                    works, in general, fans will more closely examine the strengths and weaknesses of their favorite\n                    artists and the commercial and cultural forces which drive that artist’s success. </p><br/>\n                    \n                    <p>“I think the\n                    result will be smarter, more engaged fandom, although I do fear what might happen to artists who\n                    take on investment but do not produce commercially viable products- fandom is already an emotionally\n                    intense experience,” he explained. “In some cases, artists who take on fan investors might long for\n                    the days when labels buffered their experiences with fans. So, there is no ‘one-size fits all’\n                    approach, even with all the amazing affordances of blockchain.\"</p> <br/>\n\n\n                <p className='article-p-margin'>He concluded, \"At the end of the day, art is commercial- even Shakespearre was writing\n                    to put butts in seats, and it takes a production team to facilitate that. So, while blockchain\n                    ledgers can help artists understand the ways their musical works are being used and remove huge roadblocks to financing, artists will still require myriad\n                    support for tours, collaborations, bookings, and the like. As a general rule, however, the\n                    freedoms that blockchain transactions afford are something that almost all artists clamour for.\"</p> <br/>\n                    \n
