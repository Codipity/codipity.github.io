A member state of the European Union, the small country of Estonia, in Northern Europe, is widely\n                    regarded as the premier destination for decentralized companies, exchanges, wallets and tokens who\n                    operate their platforms using cryptocurrencies, digital assets or digital ledger based tokens.\n                    The Estonian cryptocurrency license is generally the most inexpensive to acquire, the Estonian\n                    regulatory\n                    bodies are quite pro-business, and the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is supportive and\n                    helpful.\n                    Most digital entrepreneurs agree that the small country of Estonia leverages its size and forward\n                    thinking attitudes\n                    to create a welcoming environment that is 5 years ahead of jurisdictions like the United States.\n                    The Estonian cryptocurrency license allows access to the European Union market and many other\n                    jurisdictions in Asia and South America. However, as of March 10th, 2020, there are new regulations\n                    for all cryptocurrency businesses registered in Estonia. By virtue of the regulations, existing\n                    license holders had until July 1st, 2020 to comply with new laws which required existing companies\n                    that were already e-registered to now host Point of Contact (POC) local Board Members seated in\n                    local offices. There have been other changes as well. For more information on these changes, as\n                    well as additional regulations concerning license procurement, check out our article titled\n                    “Cryptocurrency licenses in Estonia; The way in.”\n\n                    Obtaining a cryptocurrency license in Estonia comes with some challenges, particularly\n                    as a foreign entrepreneur or investor, however, as mentioned, there are huge advantages\n                    for start-ups registering in Estonia. It is the opinion of Codipity LLC, the global leader in\n                    Crypto and eMoney Corporate Registrations, that Estonia is the best location on the planet,\n                    in almost all cases, for bootstrapped crypto start-ups, in the year 2020. We have therefore\n                    compiled some basic recommendations for entrepreneurs looking to register crypto businesses or\n                    raise money in the EU, as well as existing companies seeking clarity, as there have been other\n                    regulatory changes relevant to those companies also:\n                </p>\n                <ol className=\"privacy_text-ol\">\n                    <li>\n                        You will need to hire a local team. A competent service provider such as Codipity can hire your\n                        team in a part-time or full-time capacity, or you can hire this person yourself. We recommend\n                        that you hire Codipity personnel for your first year, and then make a judgement as you grow.\n                        You also have the option of moving a team member to Estonia.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        You will be required to provide criminal record documentation. Where that company cannot fulfil\n                        the requirement of proof of a non-criminal record, the FIU will decline the application. If you\n                        have a minor criminal offense, like Driving While Intoxicated, our experience is that this is\n                        not an issue, although if it was very recent, it might be. If you have committed financial\n                        crimes, or have been involved in financial misappropriation,\n                        your application will be scrutinized.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        United States Citizens and EU citizens can move to Estonia with relative ease, whereas other\n                        country’s citizens, such as Russia, may experience quotas, and should therefore apply for\n                        residency on January 1st. Some types of start-ups, such as IT, are not supposed to experience\n                        quotas, although this does not always seem like it is the case. The first step for most\n                        start-ups would be to register all members of the team that are moving to Estonia as\n                        e-residents at https://e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/. You should do this as\n                        soon as possible because it can take about 5 weeks to process and pick-up your ID\n                        in your own country. Alternatively, you can empower Co-dipity with\n                        Power of Attorney privileges to handle this for you in Estonia.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        There are regulatory requirements for your local team. It is recommended that your Local\n                        Board Member have a spotless criminal record, and that your Anti-Money Laundering professional\n                        have a law, finance, or business degree. It is not always required that the AML be located\n                        in Estonia, although the FIU may want to interview the individual, in person. In some\n                        instances for some companies, they may require the AML to be local. To avoid hiccups,\n                        hire locally. Sometimes the Local Board Member and the AML can be the same person,\n                        although an application structured as such can take longer and invite more scrutiny.\n                        If you want to hire Codipity Personnel on a one year or six month contract to ensure a\n                        smooth application process, and then bring in your own replacements, you may do so.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        There are other service providers that handle compliance and staffing in the same way that\n                        Codipity does. In some instances they will assign you a part-time employee, as some of them sit\n                        on the board of multiple companies. Be careful of this approach, because it can result in their\n                        attention and focus being divided amongst many responsibilities, which may result in\n                        unsatisfactory work. More importantly, the FIU will likely scrutinize your team, if this is\n                        the case. Hence, when you make an application for a cryptocurrency license and the FIU\n                        discovers the name of your contact person or compliance officer on multiple applications, your\n                        application is likely to be flagged and queried. Any part-time employee Codipity hires on your\n                        behalf, works only for you as a Compliance or AML professional, even if they are part-time\n                        employees. We work as a staffing agency, in some ways, so if you want to hire your Codipity\n                        assigned personnel at the end of a six month or one year contract, you may do so.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        There are office requirements for your staff. The FIU, on occasion, may visit an office to check\n                        on whether or not your employee is accessible and seated in Estonia. In your application your\n                        Estonian Board Member must provide documentation proving Estonian residency. Often a utility\n                        bill is requested. Your Local Board Member can be a resident. They do not have to be an Estonian\n                        citizen. Currently, Codipity provides a shared office space in Tallinn, for a fee, where we\n                        seat and mentor your new Board Member hires. This is generally less expensive than hiring your\n                        own team or renting an office space yourself.\n                    </li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>Note that the financial regulatory bodies are always keen to monitor and ensure the smooth operations\n                    of companies\n                    operating under the license, so it is important to have a proper management setup with a\n                    knowledgeable Board Member\n                    and AML Officer, as well as a high level of transparency in your dealings with your team as well as\n                    the FIU so that\n                    you build a healthy and lasting relationship with them.

The Estonian cryptocurrency license is generally the most\n                    inexpensive to acquire, the Estonian regulatory bodies are quite pro-business, and the Estonian\n                    Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is supportive and helpful. Most digital entrepreneurs agree\n                    that the small country of Estonia leverages its size and forward thinking attitudes to create a\n                    welcoming environment that is 5-years ahead of jurisdictions like the United States.\n                    The Estonian cryptocurrency license allows access to the European Union market and many other\n                    jurisdictions in Asia and South America. However, as of March 10th, 2020, there are new regulations\n                    for all cryptocurrency businesses registered in Estonia. By virtue of the regulations, existing\n                    license holders had until July 1st, 2020 to comply with the new laws which required existing\n                    companies that were already e-registered to now host Point of Contact (POC) Board Members seated\n                    in local offices.

The Estonian government claims that some types of jobs,\n                        such as IT, do not have quotas, although some applicants have reported difficulties.<br/>\n                        The first step would be to register all members of the team that are moving to Estonia as\n                        e-residents at <a\n                        href='https://e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/'>e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/ </a>.\n                        You should do this as soon as possible because it can take about 5 weeks to\n                        process and pick-up your ID in your own country. Alternatively, you can grant Codipity a\n                        Power of Attorney privilege to handle your incorporation in Estonia.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        There are regulatory requirements for your local team. It is recommended that your Local\n                        Board Member have a spotless criminal record, and that your Anti-Money Laundering professional\n                        have a law, finance, or business degree. It is not always required that the AML be located in\n                        Estonia, although the FIU may want to interview the individual in person. In some instances\n                        for some companies, they may require the AML to be local. To avoid hiccups, hire locally.\n                        Sometimes the Local Board Member and the AML can be the same person, although an application\n                        structured as such can take longer and invite more scrutiny. Some companies hire Codipity\n                        personnel on a six month or one year contract, to ensure a smooth application process, and then\n                        bring in their own replacements.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        There are other service providers that handle compliance and staffing in the same way that\n                        Codipity does. In some instances they will assign you a part-time employee, as some of them sit\n                        on the board of multiple companies. Be careful of this approach, because it can result in their\n                        attention and focus being divided amongst many responsibilities, which may result in\n                        unsatisfactory work. More importantly, the FIU will likely scrutinize your team, if this is\n                        the case. Hence, when you make an application for a cryptocurrency license and the\n                        FIU discovers the name of your contact person or compliance officer on multiple applications,\n                        your application is likely to be flagged and queried. Any part-time employee Codipity hires on\n                        your behalf, works only for you as a Compliance or AML professional, even if they are part-time\n                        employees. We work as a staffing agency, in some ways, so if you want to hire your Codipity\n                        assigned personnel at the end of a six month or one year contract, you may do so.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        There are office requirements for your staff. The FIU, on occasion,\n                        may visit an office to check on whether or not your employee is accessible\n                        and seated in Estonia. In your application your Estonian Board Member must provide\n                        documentation proving Estonian residency. Often a utility bill is requested. Your Local\n                        Board Member can be a resident. They do not have to be an Estonian citizen. Currently,\n                        Codipity provides a shared office space in Tallinn, for a fee, where we seat and mentor your\n                        new Board Member hires. This is generally less expensive than hiring your own team or\n                        renting an office space yourself.\n                    </li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>Note that the financial regulatory bodies are always keen to monitor and ensure the smooth operations\n                    of companies operating under the license, so it is important to have a proper management setup with\n                    a knowledgeable Board Member and AML Officer, as well as a high level of transparency in your\n                    dealings with your team as well as the FIU so that you build a healthy and lasting relationship\n                    with them.

There are many ramifications of e-residency for entrepreneurs who live in\n                        jurisdictions that are not friendly to their particular type of company, or to regular travelers\n                        who have no particular country in which they predominantly reside. When government officials,\n                        consultants or attorneys speak of e-residency, they are generally referring to the Estonian system,\n                        which is arguably the easiest and best system on the planet to register your entity if you are a\n                        digital company or digital nomad.  It is the opinion of many that this small country in Northern\n                        Europe is the most forward-thinking of all EU member states, and really, most of the world.\n                        <br/>\n                        Estonia, as one of the fastest growing digital nations, was the first to offer the e-residency program.\n                        Completion of the Estonian e-registration qualifies the entrepreneur for a government issued digital\n                        identity and legal status which gives global citizens easy access to Estonia’s digital business\n                        environment while e-registration allows them to work from any location on the planet. Estonia is\n                        widely regarded as the most transparent regulatory system for entrepreneurs to operate and apply,\n                        and Estonia is home to companies like Bolt (formerly known as Taxify), Skype, and Transferwise.\n                        The Estonian marketplace displays many service providers that can help register and support your new\n                        business and provide solutions for remote business administration.

If you are an entrepreneur, investor, financial analyst or researcher, you may have\n                    confronted stringent or bureaucratic procedures associated with obtaining such licenses in your own\n                    country and not realized that in some parts of the world, licensure is much easier. There are, in\n                    fact, some governments that act logically, and in the interest of their own citizens, rather than in\n                    the interest of the donor class and the big banks. Sometimes derided as too big to fail, those banks\n                    are propped up by government policies that make citizen’s worst nightmares come true when global\n                    economies collapse.\n                    If you happen to be living in such a country, under such as system, and\n                    you are looking for a\n                    solution to the legal conundrum confronting you and your cryptocurrency company, we have found the\n                    perfect place for your company to register- a place where there are minimal bureaucratic\n                    incongruities and zero negative perceptions of digital assets. A place where, in fact, the digital\n                    revolution is embraced in all its forms.

Luckily, it is our opinion at Codipity LLC, the global leader in Crypto and eMoney\n                    Corporate Registrations, that Estonia is by far the best jurisdiction in Europe, and probably the\n                    world, for gaining a crypto license. Compared to the less than welcoming business conditions crypto\n                    companies find in most parts of the world, and the archaic money transmitter licensing system in the\n                    United States, Estonia is an easy choice for the best place to register your bootstrapped crypto\n                    company.

The starting point then, is to understand the process of business\n                    registration for this type of company so that you can avoid any unnecessary red tape.

In Estonia, a cryptocurrency business requires an Activity License\n                    for the Provision of Financial Services, under which the Provision of Virtual Currency Services is\n                    issued by the Financial Intelligence Unit. </p>\n                <br/>\n                <p>To obtain the license, you must register your company (or a subsidiary or parent of your company), as\n                    an LLC in Estonia. Most entrepreneurs e-register their company, however, this is not compulsory,\n                    because obtaining the license may be done through a Power of Attorney at a local branch office. For\n                    a foreign company registering an affiliate in Estonia, as opposed to foreign persons registering a\n                    company, the process for obtaining a license is more complicated, because additional notarized\n                    documents are required ensuring your existing corporation is on good ethical and financial terms, in\n                    your current jurisdiction. The prerequisites to registering your Estonian crypto company are as\n                    follows:</p>\n                <ol className=\"privacy_text-ol\">\n                    <li>\n                        <b>Hire your Management Board.</b> The registration of the company is contingent on having a\n                        management\n                        board member, and often, a compliance officer, who resides in Estonia. As described in the\n                        Income Tax Act, these individuals must have good business reputations. In some cases, the\n                        compliance officer may live elsewhere, however, it might be necessary for her to go to Estonia\n                        for an in-person interview.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <b>Register your Business.</b> Business registration is one of the essential criteria for\n                        obtaining the license.

Establishing a place of business is essential as\n                        financial regulators may, from time to time, check on whether or not your listed office address\n                        is accurate. You need only one person at this office location; this is generally the duty of the\n                        local Board Member, who should be accessible at this place of business.

Whereas prior Estonian licensees needed two licenses,\n                            current applicants can make an application for a single license which covers both the Provision of a\n                            Service of Exchanging Virtual Currency against a Fiat Currency and the Provision of a Virtual\n                            Currency Wallet Service.

However, in the absence of proof of\n                    a non-criminality, a company can provide a statement indicating a clean history from a federal or\n                    state registry in the country where the company was originally set-up. Generally, it is safer to\n                    avoid the complications of applying for the license using foreign corporate shareholders. When the\n                    company is eventually registered and has obtained the license, it qualifies as a financial\n                    institution, and can at that time more easily add additional documents, ownership structures, and\n                    people. Regardless, foreign entities are not subject to special tax or reporting requirements and\n                    accounting is required according to EU and Estonian law, just like every other Estonian company.\n                    Luckily, companies like Codipity provide this service on a yearly basis, for a flat-rate, in year\n                    one, and will renegotiate in year 2, after understanding the scope of the accounting and tax work\n                    your company requires. </p>\n                <p className=\"article-p-small\">See FIU advisory guidelines <a\n                    href='https://www2.politsei.ee/dotAsset/39481.pdf'>https://www2.politsei.ee/dotAsset/39481.pdf </a>\n                </p>\n                <p className='article-p-margin'>\n                    The FIU can also make inquiries on the activities of the company.

Under federal law, a money transmitter falls under the purview of a US Money\n                    Service Business (MSB). For MSBs, a federal license is issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement\n                    Network (FinCEN), of the United States Department of Treasury. Thereafter, most MSBs must acquire\n                    Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in each individual state and territory, which means that,\n                    generally speaking, the task is herculean, and at times, downright maddening for entrepreneurs. In\n                    all, it can take up to two years to complete. Clearly stated, MTLs are difficult to come by in the\n                    US, and require a lot of legal wrangling. Crypto companies and e-money companies, in particular,\n                    bear the brunt of this bureaucracy. Generally, it motivates US entrepreneurs, who would otherwise\n                    choose a US jurisdiction, to first register companies abroad. The real losers are US taxpayers, and\n                    the many schools, roads and bridges that could be subsidized with fintech taxes. Because of the\n                    archaic way in which the US system is structured, US taxpayers lose millions each year in tax\n                    revenues when US born entrepreneurs in the digital payments sector register companies in\n                    pro-business jurisdictions like the EU. Eventually, these entrepreneurs might release their\n                    technologies in the US, after launching their company elsewhere.\n                </p>\n\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"privacy_flex-column site-block__wrapper margin-top-0\">\n                <p>But by doing so the lion’s share of\n                    tax revenues go to that non-US jurisdiction. In some cases, the entrepreneurs are incorporated in,\n                    and paying taxes to, a country they have never even visited. Most incubators and start-up hubs\n                    understand that the next Facebook, Google, or Amazon may not be a US company, because the US is\n                    failing to retain and recruit innovators. The truth is that while the US is floundering, small\n                    countries in the EU like Estonia are recruiting A-list entrepreneurs from premier start-up programs\n                    and US Universities. Transferwise, a company registered in Estonia, despite being a product of\n                    Silicon Valley’s Y-Combinator start-up school, are a prime example of a billion dollar company that\n                    opted for the EU, but may have stayed in the US, if the United States were friendly to businesses\n                    operating as payment service providers.\n                </p>\n\n\n\n                <div className=\"flex site-block__wrapper marginTop20 column-wrap\">\n                    <img src={ImageArticle01} className=\" leftimg marginTop20\"/>\n                    <div className='flex-column marginTop10'>\n                    <h2>How did it get this way?</h2>\n                        <p className=\"article-p-margin\">In a bid to create a uniform system and consistent approach to the way\n                            money services are carried\n                            out, the Uniform Money Services Act was passed in 2000 as a guideline for MSBs. At the federal\n                            level, registering an MSB is not difficult. It is in the states, where the problems lie. While it is\n                            possible for the founder of an MSB to submit an application to the National Multi-State Licensing\n                            system (NMLS) him or herself, most decide to hire a US-based attorney (at $200-$500 per hour) to\n                            handle the extremely complex application process, because, on a scale of 1 to 10, the difficulty and\n                            magnitude of the MTL process is a 9 or a 10. Each state has an application and a separate fee. State\n                            fees will total somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 and attorney fees will generally cost an\n                            additional $300,000 or more. Unfortunately, most early stage start-ups do not have this kind of\n                            money prior to having customers. On top of that, banks and trusts charge up to $10,000 per month for\n                            a deposit account where payment service providers or e-money technologies can pool their funds,\n                            although these costs vary, largely depend on the type of service a company provides, and rely on how\n                            a technology operates. In no uncertain terms, to launch an e-money business in the United States is\n                            next to impossible without funding or private wealth.\n\n                        </p></div>\n                </div>\n\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">To combat this nightmare, most entrepreneurs\n                    choose to register their company, initially, in a more business friendly jurisdiction. Others opt\n                    for more efficient processes in the US where they are exempt from MSB status, or they choose to\n                    partner with a service provider like Codipity, the global leader in corporate registrations and\n                    consultations, to handle the state-by-state MTLs, at a flat-rate. Codipity not only assists with the\n                    registration process, but also helps companies document the flow of funds, explore license coverage,\n                    and submit the necessary applications to each state. In essence, Codipity helps entrepreneurs\n                    navigate the entire Money Service Business process. To be clear, although Codipity is registered in\n                    the EU as a “Trust and Company Services” provider, the organization specifically offers its MTL\n                    service from its US-based office, spearheaded by a US-licensed attorney. Codipity clients therefore\n                    receive discounted rates on US legal work. In some cases, Codipity will conduct legal or\n                    consultatory work in exchange for equity. Prior to using Codipity, however, an entrepreneur should consider all\n                    of the options at their disposal. Therefore, the following 6 strategies are recommended by Codipity\n                    for entrepreneurs seeking Money Transmitter Licenses. Start-ups can (1) affiliate; (2) become a\n                    correspondent; (3) become an Independent Sales Organization; (4) enter an agent program; (5) own a\n                    license; or, (6) become a banking agent.</p>\n\n\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Affiliate</h2>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">As an affiliate, you are responsible for the sale of the product or\n                    services on behalf of a license holder and you gain commission on each transaction you effect.\n                    Basically, you are unlicensed, but can carry on business just like a person or business entity that\n                    is licensed to do so. By law, an affiliate cannot access, disburse or spend any funds because the\n                    client is actually that of the principal license holder. Hence, the principal license holder is\n                    responsible for handling the funds. If you are a payments app that merely takes a transaction fee,\n                    but does not have access to the sender accounts or the receiver accounts, you are generally\n                    structured as an affiliate. Companies like Stripe, Dwolla, and Plaid facilitate these types of\n                    white-label transactions for you, through the Buyer and Seller bank accounts. While you can take\n                    transaction fees as an affiliate, your company is never in possession of the actual funds being\n                    transferred. These are sometimes referred to as “white-label” relationships because your company\n                    branding will remain on the service, but you are not actually conducting the transaction. Your\n                    ability to utilize an affiliate relationship is a question of how you have designed your technology\n                    to facilitate the flow of funds. </p>\n\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Correspondent</h2>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\"> Unlike an affiliate, a correspondent is a partner of the principal\n                    license holder who receives legal instruction to effect cross border transactions. Correspondence is\n                    not limited to individuals or licensed personnel; it is most often referenced in the context of\n                    banking. Entrepreneurs in the digital payments sector will therefore need to find a correspondent\n                    bank to conduct business in the United States. There are domestic correspondents and foreign\n                    correspondents. If you are a European entity, your US correspondent would be a foreign\n                    correspondent. To be a foreign correspondent, a contract between you and the principal license\n                    holder in the US is required. This contract allows for transactions to be sent for settlement or\n                    termination. In each case, a correspondent agreement is required; this agreement must be presented\n                    to state regulators in the event of an audit. Just like an affiliate is not legally empowered to\n                    touch funds, as a correspondent, you are not legally empowered to enact transactions from the US,\n                    independent of the principal license holder. However, a correspondent can receive funds from a US\n                    Money Service Business (MSB). Local correspondents are internally licensed entities who offer\n                    similar services in jurisdictions where you are not licensed. In this case, a correspondent contract\n                    does not invoke licensure rights on the contract but merely allows for a transaction to be settled.\n                    It is pertinent to mention that when a transaction originates from a correspondent, that\n                    correspondent has legal ownership of it, and neither the domestic nor the foreign correspondent can\n                    canvas business in the other’s country. For example, a Puerto Rican bank, called an International\n                    Financial Entity (IFE), therefore, will need to find a US correspondent bank if it wishes to acquire\n                    US customers who are individuals rather than businesses. </p>\n\n\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Independent Sales Organization</h2>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\"> Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) can also be used for money\n                    transmission. An ISO Agreement serves several purposes. First, the ISO agreement is issued by the\n                    Principal License Holder to the ISO which enables the ISO to sell or promote its products and\n                    services. Basically, the Agreement is established by the Principal License Holder in order to market\n                    their own products or services, however an ISO also acts as a correspondent. In its dealings with\n                    the Money Service Business, the Money Service Business remains the legal owner, and the flow of\n                    funds passes through the bank account of the Money Service Business, but the ISO can still solicit\n                    or canvass for business in the Principal License Holder’s jurisdiction.

In this kind of arrangement, the\n                    start-up is a Money Transfer Operator (MTO) and functions as an authorized delegate. At launch, the\n                    start-up can own its own brand and directly onboard clients in the interest of the Principal License\n                    Holder. In this arrangement, the flow of funds travels through the bank of the Principal License\n                    Holder, and the products or services that the start-up markets must be in line with the services the\n                    Principal License Holder sells. Each agent working for the start-up must be conscious of this rule\n                    for the sake of regulatory compliance. Usually statutory regulators monitor the nature of agency\n                    relationships because there have been some careless PLH arrangements that have turned criminal.\n                    Criminality occurs when a license is “rented” and unmonitored by the Principal License Holder. If\n                    your start-up intends to carry out business that falls within the territory of the state of Texas,\n                    for example, there are relevant cases which cracked down on PLH’s who rented their licenses and did\n                    not properly monitor the usage. The <a\n                        href='https://www.dob.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/Laws-Regulations/New-Actions/sm1038.pdf'>Supervisory\n                        Memorandum (1038)</a>, from the Texas Department of\n                    Banking (2014), is worth perusing, especially for companies using virtual currencies.\n\n                    As an authorized delegate or agent, you will be required by the license holder to provide a brief\n                    summary of your business. That summary will include a project plan, a projected revenue model for at\n                    least one year, a mapped out funds flow chart including various payment paths (USD v. crypto paths\n                    for example) and the jurisdiction of the business. Most PLHs will require that you indicate the\n                    number of states you will carry out business operations in, as well as the time it will take to\n                    kickstart the business. If your proposal is successful, a Principal License Holder will then allow\n                    you to move on to the next stage of due diligence.\n                </p>\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Banking Agent</h2>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">Banks in the US are not required to adhere to Money Transmitter License\n                    requirements by virtue of their Banking Charter. And, they can appoint subsidiaries who\n                    automatically become free from the rigours of acquiring a Money Transmitter License. </p>\n\n\n                <div className=\"flex site-block__wrapper column-wrap\">\n                    <div className='flex-column marginTop50'>\n                        <h2>Own Your License</h2>\n                        <p className=\"article-p-margin\">Owning your MTL licenses outright is the ideal way to ensure your\n                            ability to run a money service business. Generally, Codipity can register your entity in the US or\n                            get you registered as an MSB, at the federal level, without too much difficulty. However, as\n                            mentioned, the method to acquire MTLs in each state, is no walk in the park. Generally, you must\n                            consider the type of resources you have, the amount of time you have to process the material and\n                            await a response, and the manpower it requires to compile all the documentation. While in the past,\n                            you may have written a white paper as a way to organize your ideas, the Money Transmitter Licenses\n                            will require a robust business plan, and many other documents which are quite complex. For most\n                            entrepreneurs, the main issue confronting their choice concerns the issue of funding. If you are a\n                            bootstrapped crypto startup, the best approach may be to register your company first in an agreeable\n                            environment such as the EU, grow your business, build a clientele base, and garner financial\n                            stability there before tackling the US market because the state licenses will each require you to\n                            demonstrate a minimum net worth, a surety bond of $500,000 or $1,000,000 (depending on the state), a\n                            compliance team, full time backend support, and a tech team.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <img src={ImageArticle02} className=\"privacy-warning-img-page rightImg-sml marginTop80\"/>\n\n                </div>\n                <p className='marginTop10'>You will also be required to meet the\n                    high standards of the US Bank Secrecy Act as it relates to your KYC and AML program. Other factors to\n                    consider are the annual license, solicitor, and audit fees; documentation of criminal convictions in\n                    the last 10 years; financial disclosures from yourself and your investors; and documentation\n                    concerning your banking partnerships and limitations, to name but a few of the documents. After\n                    compiling everything necessary for one state, the most frustrating part of all of it is that the\n                    requirements vary from state to state, so you will need to rinse and repeat the step about 30 times.\n                    The one bit of silver lining through all the bureaucracy is that a group of states do have a\n                    Multi-State MSB Licensing agreement (called the MMLA) which allows you to submit one application for\n                    26 states, at once. California, Illinois and Texas are currently part of that MMLA group, which gets\n                    you some major metropolitan populations such as LA, San Francisco, Chicago, and Houston. The New\n                    York Bit License, however, is a mind blowing $150,000 for just one state. Knowing that similar\n                    licensure to the New York Bit License, is available for the totality of Europe, for about 1/10 the\n                    capital investment, makes most entrepreneurs cringe at the cost-benefit analysis.</p>\n\n                <h2 style={{'marginTop': '20px'}}>Where should I start?</h2>\n\n\n                <p className='article-p-margin'>Generally, apart from meeting the requirements for running a Money\n                    Service Business, Money Transmitters in the US also deal with a variety of supervisory bodies at the\n                    state level, depending on which states the Money Transmitter Business will transact. It is important\n                    for Money Transmitters to institute measures of recordkeeping, file currency reports regularly, and\n                    document suspicious activity with SARs. But, the greatest challenge is understanding each law that\n                    is applicable to conducting business in each state. This is why Codipity does not recommend\n                    bootstrapping this part of your business (in any standard pro se or DIY approach), unless time is\n                    not of the essence and you have 2 or 3 years to get acclimated to the application system.

acquiring Money Transmitter Licenses\n                    (MTLs) in the United States is a difficult process. The degree of difficulty, of course, varies from\n                    state to state, and the extent of an entrepreneur's nightmare depends (1) on the specific state\n                    where she is seeking the license and (2) the type of business she intends to conduct. While the\n                    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regulates the activities of MSBs at the federal level,\n                    each state, save the state of Montana, has local statutes that regulate the operations of money\n                    transmitters. These states require the registration of anyone seeking money transmitter status. Even\n                    though money transmitters in the state of Montana aren’t required to be licensed with the division\n                    of Banking and Financial Institutions like most states require, in order to carry out money transfer\n                    services MSBs must still register as a business with the Montana Secretary of State. There are,\n                    however, common threads linking the registration processes and expectations of each state such as\n                    compulsory fees for license application and renewals. But, because there is no general license that\n                    covers the operation of money transmission services in the US, an applicant must obtain a license in\n                    each state she intends to carry out business. The challenge of this is that she must familiarize\n                    herself with the rules that apply in each of the 50 states and 5 territories, since the rules that\n                    apply in state ‘A’ are likely different from what would apply in state ‘B’.\n                    As a consequence, a\n                    license seeker has to deal with a diverse range of regulations if she wants to operate in each\n                    state.\n                </p>\n\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"privacy_flex-column site-block__wrapper margin-top-0\">\n                <p className='marginTop10'> Moreso, the general license regulatory requirements are susceptible to change or amendments.\n                    While Codipity provides a flat-rate service to lead entrepreneurs through the MTL storm, below are\n                    the links to help pro se (DIY) applicants conduct the research and submit the required documents to\n                    55 different US jurisdictions themselves:\n                </p>\n\n                <ol className=\"privacy_text-ol\">\n                    {linksList.map((item) =>\n                        <li>\n                            <div className=\"flex-column\">\n                                <a href={item.stateNameLink}>{item.stateName}</a>\n                                <a href={item.transferNameLink}>{item.transferName}</a></div>\n                        </li>\n                    )}\n                </ol>\n\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Applicants begin by filling out the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) Forms (1) for\n                    Individuals and (2) for Companies, which are the documents that sole proprietors and companies use\n                    for maintaining non-depository, financial service licenses for state agencies associated with MTLs.\n                    An applicant is also required to list the beneficial owners, and to list the managers. Last, an\n                    applicant must submit the NMLS Branch Form used by companies to apply for and maintain licenses for\n                    each non-depository, financial services branch location, if applicable. As a legal requirement,\n                    applicants also must hold insurance. Various state laws require licensees to obtain surety bonds as\n                    a condition of licensure because when a licensee fails to comply with the requirements, a regulator\n                    files claims against the bond to cover the penalties.\n\n                </p>\n                <p className=\"article-p-margin\">\n                    Financial regulators are stalwarts of the Money Transmitters Regulators Association (MTRA), an\n                    organization that is responsible for the implementation of the laws in all 55 jurisdictions. The\n                    NMLS, which was instituted by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the American\n                    Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators (AARMR) in 2008, aims to improve coordination,\n                    efficiency and information sharing among regulators and to enhance consumer protection.\n                    Unfortunately, compared to processes in most parts of the world, the US system is considered to be\n                    ineffective, if not broken, as a result of the cumbersome processes involved with obtaining a\n                    license and the lack of uniformity across the states. The difficulties are further exacerbated\n                    because license seekers are rarely confident about what is required. Recently, an NMLS Policy\n                    Guidebook was released as a resource material for applicants, licensees, and regulatory agencies. To\n                    summarize, the requirements handled through common processes include (1) Annual Renewals; (2)\n                    Electronic Surety Bonds; (3) Financial Statements; (4) Advanced Change Notices; (5) Policies; (6)\n                    Professional Standards which include Criminal background checks, Completing pre-licensure education\n                    requirements, Prometric tests, and Credit Report Authorizations; (7) Mortgage Call Reports; (8)\n                    Money Services Businesses Call Reports; (9) Temporary Authorities to Operate; and (10) Uniform\n                    Authorized Agent Delegate Reports. However, with the publication of the guidebook, it is hoped that\n                    applicants will have a proper understanding of the policies that apply when using the NMLS.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"flex site-block__wrapper column-wrap\">\n                    <div className='flex-column'>\n                    <p className=\"marginTop10\">Generally, what makes the application process cumbersome is the ripple\n                        effect across states, industries, and continents because the global community generally looks to the\n                        United States for clarity on economic and financial issues, as the United States is the world’s\n                        largest economy. When the US falters, or fails to correct its inefficiencies, the world suffers\n                        along with the US taxpayers. In some instances however, pro-business foreign governments can fill\n                        the leadership vacuum.

When the US falters, or fails to correct its inefficiencies, the world suffers\n                    along with the US taxpayers. In some instances however, pro-business foreign governments can fill\n                    the leadership vacuum.
