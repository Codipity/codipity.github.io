A member state of the European Union, the small country of Estonia, in Northern Europe, is widely regarded as the premier destination for decentralized companies, exchanges, wallets and tokens who operate their platforms using cryptocurrencies, digital assets or digital ledger based tokens. The Estonian cryptocurrency license is generally the most inexpensive to acquire, the Estonian regulatory bodies are quite pro-business, and the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is supportive and helpful. Most digital entrepreneurs agree that the small country of Estonia leverages its size and forward thinking attitudes to create a welcoming environment that is 5 years ahead of jurisdictions like the United States. The Estonian cryptocurrency license allows access to the European Union market and many other jurisdictions in Asia and South America. However, as of March 10th, 2020, there are new regulations for all cryptocurrency businesses registered in Estonia. By virtue of the regulations, existing license holders had until July 1st, 2020 to comply with new laws which required existing companies that were already e-registered to now host Point of Contact (POC) local Board Members seated in local offices. There have been other changes as well. For more information on these changes, as well as additional regulations concerning license procurement, check out our blog post titled \u201cCryptocurrency licenses in Estonia; The way in.\u201d Obtaining a cryptocurrency license in Estonia comes with some challenges, particularly as a foreign entrepreneur or investor, however, as mentioned, there are huge advantages for start-ups registering in Estonia. It is the opinion of Codipity LLC, the global leader in Crypto and eMoney Corporate Registrations, that Estonia is the best location on the planet, in almost all cases, for bootstrapped crypto start-ups, in the year 2020. We have therefore compiled some basic recommendations for entrepreneurs looking to register crypto businesses or raise money in the EU, as well as existing companies seeking clarity, as there have been other regulatory changes relevant to those companies also:"),i.a.createElement("ol",{className:"privacy_text-ol"},i.a.createElement("li",null,"You will need to hire a local team. A competent service provider such as Codipity can hire your team in a part-time or full-time capacity, or you can hire this person yourself.

You also have the option of moving a team member to Estonia."),i.a.createElement("li",null,"You will be required to provide criminal record documentation. Where that company cannot fulfil the requirement of proof of a non-criminal record, the FIU will decline the application.

Some types of start-ups, such as IT, are not supposed to experience quotas, although this does not always seem like it is the case. The first step for most start-ups would be to register all members of the team that are moving to Estonia as e-residents at https://e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/. You should do this as soon as possible because it can take about 5 weeks to process and pick-up your ID in your own country.

It is recommended that your Local Board Member have a spotless criminal record, and that your Anti-Money Laundering professional have a law, finance, or business degree. It is not always required that the AML be located in Estonia, although the FIU may want to interview the individual, in person. In some instances for some companies, they may require the AML to be local. To avoid hiccups, hire locally. Sometimes the Local Board Member and the AML can be the same person, although an application structured as such can take longer and invite more scrutiny. If you want to hire Codipity Personnel on a one year or six month contract to ensure a smooth application process, and then bring in your own replacements, you may do so."),i.a.createElement("li",null,"There are other service providers that handle compliance and staffing in the same way that Codipity does. In some instances they will assign you a part-time employee, as some of them sit on the board of multiple companies. Be careful of this approach, because it can result in their attention and focus being divided amongst many responsibilities, which may result in unsatisfactory work. More importantly, the FIU will likely scrutinize your team, if this is the case. Hence, when you make an application for a cryptocurrency license and the FIU discovers the name of your contact person or compliance officer on multiple applications, your application is likely to be flagged and queried. Any part-time employee Codipity hires on your behalf, works only for you as a Compliance or AML professional, even if they are part-time employees. We work as a staffing agency, in some ways, so if you want to hire your Codipity assigned personnel at the end of a six month or one year contract, you may do so."),i.a.createElement("li",null,"There are office requirements for your staff. The FIU, on occasion, may visit an office to check on whether or not your employee is accessible and seated in Estonia. In your application your Estonian Board Member must provide documentation proving Estonian residency. Often a utility bill is requested. Your Local Board Member can be a resident. They do not have to be an Estonian citizen. Currently, Codipity provides a shared office space in Tallinn, for a fee, where we seat and mentor your new Board Member hires.

Luckily, Codipity LLC, the global leader in corporate registrations, includes all negotiations and follow-ups in the flat-rate services.The FIU generally declines an application for two reasons. The first occurs when there is insufficient procedural documentation. The second is when the provision of evidence of a non- criminal record has not been sufficiently detailed. When the applicant is owned by a parent company or when a foreign corporate shareholder cannot provide proof of non-criminality, it poses a logistical problem. While founder backgrounds are generally not difficult to prove, it is quite difficult to prove non-criminality for a registering parent entity, if the new Estonian company is a subsidiary.

However, in the absence of proof of a non-criminality, a company can provide a statement indicating a clean history from a federal or state registry in the country where the company was originally set-up. Generally, it is safer to avoid the complications of applying for the license using foreign corporate shareholders. When the company is eventually registered and has obtained the license, it qualifies as a financial institution, and can at that time more easily add additional documents, ownership structures, and people. Regardless, foreign entities are not subject to special tax or reporting requirements and accounting is required according to EU and Estonian law, just like every other Estonian company.

Under federal law, a money transmitter falls under the purview of a US Money Service Business (MSB). For MSBs, a federal license is issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), of the United States Department of Treasury. Thereafter, most MSBs must acquire Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in each individual state and territory, which means that, generally speaking, the task is herculean, and at times, downright maddening for entrepreneurs. In all, it can take up to two years to complete. Clearly stated, MTLs are difficult to come by in the US, and require a lot of legal wrangling. Crypto companies and e-money companies, in particular, bear the brunt of this bureaucracy. Generally, it motivates US entrepreneurs, who would otherwise choose a US jurisdiction, to first register companies abroad. The real losers are US taxpayers, and the many schools, roads and bridges that could be subsidized with fintech taxes. Because of the archaic way in which the US system is structured, US taxpayers lose millions each year in tax revenues when US born entrepreneurs in the digital payments sector register companies in pro-business jurisdictions like the EU.

The truth is that while the US is floundering, small countries in the EU like Estonia are recruiting A-list entrepreneurs from premier start-up programs and US Universities. Transferwise, a company registered in Estonia, despite being a product of Silicon Valley\u2019s Y-Combinator start-up school, are a prime example of a billion dollar company that opted for the EU, but may have stayed in the US, if the United States were friendly to businesses operating as payment service providers."),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"flex site-block__wrapper marginTop20 column-wrap"},i.a.createElement("img",{src:tt.a,className:" leftimg marginTop20"}),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"flex-column marginTop10"},i.a.createElement("h2",null,"How did it get this way?"),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"article-p-margin"},"In a bid to create a uniform system and consistent approach to the way money services are carried out, the Uniform Money Services Act was passed in 2000 as a guideline for MSBs. At the federal level, registering an MSB is not difficult. It is in the states, where the problems lie. While it is possible for the founder of an MSB to submit an application to the National Multi-State Licensing system (NMLS) him or herself, most decide to hire a US-based attorney (at $200-$500 per hour) to handle the extremely complex application process, because, on a scale of 1 to 10, the difficulty and magnitude of the MTL process is a 9 or a 10. Each state has an application and a separate fee. State fees will total somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 and attorney fees will generally cost an additional $300,000 or more. Unfortunately, most early stage start-ups do not have this kind of money prior to having customers. On top of that, banks and trusts charge up to $10,000 per month for a deposit account where payment service providers or e-money technologies can pool their funds, although these costs vary, largely depend on the type of service a company provides, and rely on how a technology operates. In no uncertain terms, to launch an e-money business in the United States is next to impossible without funding or private wealth."))),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"article-p-margin"},"To combat this nightmare, most entrepreneurs choose to register their company, initially, in a more business friendly jurisdiction. Others opt for more efficient processes in the US where they are exempt from MSB status, or they choose to partner with a service provider like Codipity, the global leader in corporate registrations and consultations, to handle the state-by-state MTLs, at a flat-rate. Codipity not only assists with the registration process, but also helps companies document the flow of funds, explore license coverage, and submit the necessary applications to each state. In essence, Codipity helps entrepreneurs navigate the entire Money Service Business process. To be clear, although Codipity is registered in the EU as a \u201cTrust and Company Services\u201d provider, the organization specifically offers its MTL service from its US-based office, spearheaded by a US-licensed attorney. Codipity clients therefore receive discounted rates on US legal work. In some cases, Codipity will conduct legal or consultatory work in exchange for equity. Prior to using Codipity, however, an entrepreneur should consider all of the options at their disposal. Therefore, the following 6 strategies are recommended by Codipity for entrepreneurs seeking Money Transmitter Licenses. Start-ups can (1) affiliate; (2) become a correspondent; (3) become an Independent Sales Organization; (4) enter an agent program; (5) own a license; or, (6) become a banking agent."),i.a.createElement("h2",{style:{marginTop:"20px"}},"Affiliate"),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"article-p-margin"},"As an affiliate, you are responsible for the sale of the product or services on behalf of a license holder and you gain commission on each transaction you effect. Basically, you are unlicensed, but can carry on business just like a person or business entity that is licensed to do so. By law, an affiliate cannot access, disburse or spend any funds because the client is actually that of the principal license holder. Hence, the principal license holder is responsible for handling the funds. If you are a payments app that merely takes a transaction fee, but does not have access to the sender accounts or the receiver accounts, you are generally structured as an affiliate. Companies like Stripe, Dwolla, and Plaid facilitate these types of white-label transactions for you, through the Buyer and Seller bank accounts. While you can take transaction fees as an affiliate, your company is never in possession of the actual funds being transferred. These are sometimes referred to as \u201cwhite-label\u201d relationships because your company branding will remain on the service, but you are not actually conducting the transaction. Your ability to utilize an affiliate relationship is a question of how you have designed your technology to facilitate the flow of funds. "),i.a.createElement("h2",{style:{marginTop:"20px"}},"Correspondent"),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"article-p-margin"}," Unlike an affiliate, a correspondent is a partner of the principal license holder who receives legal instruction to effect cross border transactions. Correspondence is not limited to individuals or licensed personnel; it is most often referenced in the context of banking. Entrepreneurs in the digital payments sector will therefore need to find a correspondent bank to conduct business in the United States. There are domestic correspondents and foreign correspondents. If you are a European entity, your US correspondent would be a foreign correspondent. To be a foreign correspondent, a contract between you and the principal license holder in the US is required. This contract allows for transactions to be sent for settlement or termination. In each case, a correspondent agreement is required; this agreement must be presented to state regulators in the event of an audit. Just like an affiliate is not legally empowered to touch funds, as a correspondent, you are not legally empowered to enact transactions from the US, independent of the principal license holder. However, a correspondent can receive funds from a US Money Service Business (MSB). Local correspondents are internally licensed entities who offer similar services in jurisdictions where you are not licensed. In this case, a correspondent contract does not invoke licensure rights on the contract but merely allows for a transaction to be settled. It is pertinent to mention that when a transaction originates from a correspondent, that correspondent has legal ownership of it, and neither the domestic nor the foreign correspondent can canvas business in the other\u2019s country. For example, a Puerto Rican bank, called an International Financial Entity (IFE), therefore, will need to find a US correspondent bank if it wishes to acquire US customers who are individuals rather than businesses. "),i.a.createElement("h2",{style:{marginTop:"20px"}},"Independent Sales Organization"),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"article-p-margin"}," Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) can also be used for money transmission. An ISO Agreement serves several purposes. First, the ISO agreement is issued by the Principal License Holder to the ISO which enables the ISO to sell or promote its products and services. Basically, the Agreement is established by the Principal License Holder in order to market their own products or services, however an ISO also acts as a correspondent. In its dealings with the Money Service Business, the Money Service Business remains the legal owner, and the flow of funds passes through the bank account of the Money Service Business, but the ISO can still solicit or canvass for business in the Principal License Holder\u2019s jurisdiction. The websites, apps, and platforms that the ISO uses to sell the products remains property of the ISO, not the PLH. "),i.a.createElement("h2",{style:{marginTop:"20px"}},"Agent Program"),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"article-p-margin"}," Agent programs allow entrepreneurs to acquire money transmitter licenses from a corporate entity who is a Principal License Holder. In this kind of arrangement, the start-up is a Money Transfer Operator (MTO) and functions as an authorized delegate. At launch, the start-up can own its own brand and directly onboard clients in the interest of the Principal License Holder. In this arrangement, the flow of funds travels through the bank of the Principal License Holder, and the products or services that the start-up markets must be in line with the services the Principal License Holder sells. Each agent working for the start-up must be conscious of this rule for the sake of regulatory compliance. Usually statutory regulators monitor the nature of agency relationships because there have been some careless PLH arrangements that have turned criminal. Criminality occurs when a license is \u201crented\u201d and unmonitored by the Principal License Holder. If your start-up intends to carry out business that falls within the territory of the state of Texas, for example, there are relevant cases which cracked down on PLH\u2019s who rented their licenses and did not properly monitor the usage. The ",i.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://www.dob.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/Laws-Regulations/New-Actions/sm1038.pdf"},"Supervisory Memorandum (1038)"),", from the Texas Department of Banking (2014), is worth perusing, especially for companies using virtual currencies. As an authorized delegate or agent, you will be required by the license holder to provide a brief summary of your business. That summary will include a project plan, a projected revenue model for at least one year, a mapped out funds flow chart including various payment paths (USD v. crypto paths for example) and the jurisdiction of the business. Most PLHs will require that you indicate the number of states you will carry out business operations in, as well as the time it will take to kickstart the business. If your proposal is successful, a Principal License Holder will then allow you to move on to the next stage of due diligence."),i.a.createElement("h2",{style:{marginTop:"20px"}},"Banking Agent"),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"article-p-margin"},"Banks in the US are not required to adhere to Money Transmitter License requirements by virtue of their Banking Charter.

Generally, Codipity can register your entity in the US or get you registered as an MSB, at the federal level, without too much difficulty. However, as mentioned, the method to acquire MTLs in each state, is no walk in the park. Generally, you must consider the type of resources you have, the amount of time you have to process the material and await a response, and the manpower it requires to compile all the documentation. While in the past, you may have written a white paper as a way to organize your ideas, the Money Transmitter Licenses will require a robust business plan, and many other documents which are quite complex. For most entrepreneurs, the main issue confronting their choice concerns the issue of funding. If you are a bootstrapped crypto startup, the best approach may be to register your company first in an agreeable environment such as the EU, grow your business, build a clientele base, and garner financial stability there before tackling the US market because the state licenses will each require you to demonstrate a minimum net worth, a surety bond of $500,000 or $1,000,000 (depending on the state), a compliance team, full time backend support, and a tech team.")),i.a.createElement("img",{src:nt.a,className:"privacy-warning-img-page rightImg-sml marginTop80"})),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"marginTop10"},"You will also be required to meet the high standards of the US Patriot Act as it relates to your KYC and AML program. Other factors to consider are the annual license, solicitor, and audit fees; documentation of criminal convictions in the last 10 years; financial disclosures from yourself and your investors; and documentation concerning your banking partnerships and limitations, to name but a few of the documents. After compiling everything necessary for one state, the most frustrating part of all of it is that the requirements vary from state to state, so you will need to rinse and repeat the step about 30 times. The one bit of silver lining through all the bureaucracy is that a group of states do have a Multi-State MSB Licensing agreement (called the MMLA) which allows you to submit one application for 26 states, at once. California, Illinois and Texas are currently part of that MMLA group, which gets you some major metropolitan populations such as LA, San Francisco, Chicago, and Houston. The New York Bit License, however, is a mind blowing $150,000 for just one state. Knowing that similar licensure to the New York Bit License, is available for the totality of Europe, for about 1/10 the capital investment, makes most entrepreneurs cringe at the cost-benefit analysis."),i.a.createElement("h2",{style:{marginTop:"20px"}},"Where should I start?"),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"article-p-margin"},"Generally, apart from meeting the requirements for running a Money Service Business, Money Transmitters in the US also deal with a variety of supervisory bodies at the state level, depending on which states the Money Transmitter Business will transact.

But, the greatest challenge is understanding each law that is applicable to conducting business in each state.

Businesses, acquiring Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in the United States is a difficult process. The degree of difficulty, of course, varies from state to state, and the extent of an entrepreneur's nightmare depends (1) on the specific state where she is seeking the license and (2) the type of business she intends to conduct. While the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regulates the activities of MSBs at the federal level, each state, save the state of Montana, has local statutes that regulate the operations of money transmitters. These states require the registration of anyone seeking money transmitter status. Even though money transmitters in the state of Montana aren\u2019t required to be licensed with the division of Banking and Financial Institutions like most states require, in order to carry out money transfer services MSBs must still register as a business with the Montana Secretary of State. There are, however, common threads linking the registration processes and expectations of each state such as compulsory fees for license application and renewals. But, because there is no general license that covers the operation of money transmission services in the US, an applicant must obtain a license in each state she intends to carry out business. The challenge of this is that she must familiarize herself with the rules that apply in each of the 50 states and 5 territories, since the rules that apply in state \u2018A\u2019 are likely different from what would apply in state \u2018B\u2019.

An applicant is also required to list the beneficial owners, and to list the managers. Last, an applicant must submit the NMLS Branch Form used by companies to apply for and maintain licenses for each non-depository, financial services branch location, if applicable. As a legal requirement, applicants also must hold insurance.

Unfortunately, compared to processes in most parts of the world, the US system is considered to be ineffective, if not broken, as a result of the cumbersome processes involved with obtaining a license and the lack of uniformity across the states. The difficulties are further exacerbated because license seekers are rarely confident about what is required. Recently, an NMLS Policy Guidebook was released as a resource material for applicants, licensees, and regulatory agencies. To summarize, the requirements handled through common processes include (1) Annual Renewals; (2) Electronic Surety Bonds; (3) Financial Statements; (4) Advanced Change Notices; (5) Policies; (6) Professional Standards which include Criminal background checks, Completing pre-licensure education requirements, Prometric tests, and Credit Report Authorizations; (7) Mortgage Call Reports; (8) Money Services Businesses Call Reports; (9) Temporary Authorities to Operate; and (10) Uniform Authorized Agent Delegate Reports.
